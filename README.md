# Programming Portfolio

Welcome to my programming portfolio! This collection includes a variety of projects I've developed across multiple programming languages, showcasing different skills and technologies.

## Featured Projects

### Employee Manager (Java)
A comprehensive desktop GUI application for managing employees.  
- Secure login system (Username: `manager`, Password: `user`)  
- Intuitive interface for adding, editing, and managing employee data  
- Built with Java Swing, emphasizing application structure and event-driven programming  

### Star Slayer Beta (Godot)  
A 2D space shooter prototype created using the Godot Engine.  
- Engaging gameplay mechanics and controls  
- Exploration of game development principles and design  
- Utilizes Godot’s scene system and scripting for smooth gameplay  

These two represent my largest and most in-depth projects, combining both technical complexity and practical application.

## Other Projects

While smaller in scope, these projects helped me solidify foundational programming concepts and build useful tools:

### C Projects

- **Basic Calculator**  
A command-line calculator supporting multi-digit and floating-point input, with operators +, -, *, /, including division-by-zero handling.  

- **Shell**  
A simple custom shell implementing basic Unix commands (`cd`, `ls`, `exit`), with command parsing and a minimal terminal interface.  

### Python Projects

- **Tretis**  
A Tetris-inspired game built with Python’s `pygame` module for learning game logic and event handling.
